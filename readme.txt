Send SMS'es and enable SMS-based two-factor security.

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to send SMS messages straight from the WordPress backend or via the programmer‚Äôs API.

Also included is a free and easy-to-use two-factor security feature, which hardens the security of your site considerably.

All you need is the plugin and a free [GatewayAPI.com](https://gatewayapi.com/) account.


Main features:

* **üì± Send SMS messages / texts**
  *   Add custom data to recipients to mail merge.
  *   Import recipient lists from CSV/Excel.
  *   Group recipients.
  *   Bulk-sending.
  *   Easy-to-use programmer‚Äôs API.
  *   Short-codes for signup/unsubscribe/edit profile forms.
  *   Automatic integration with Contact Form 7.

* **üîê Two-factor security**
  *   Easy-to-use: No apps needed!

*   Company founded in 1999.
*   Free support, no subscription, AND unbeatable prices.
*   Most SMS messages are delivered within 0,3 seconds.

If you prefer to disable the UI-features and manage broadcasts from code instead, then that is possible as well. For this purpose you can use the method `gwapi_send_sms` which accepts arguments for message, recipient(s), sender-text and type of SMS.


= Getting Started =

We have created a number of short tutorials, demonstrating how to get started and use the various features. Watch the following video to see how to set everything up and send your first SMS message:

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install and use the plugin

1. If you haven‚Äôt already, then go to [GatewayAPI.com](https://gatewayapi.com/) and create a free account.
1. Install and activate the plugin.
1. Go to ‚ÄúSettings ¬ª GatewayAPI Settings‚Äù and add an OAuth key and associated secret from your GatewayAPI.com account.
1. (Optional) Enable the sending UI and then go to ‚ÄúSMS messages ¬ª Create SMS‚Äù and try to send an SMS to yourself, verifying that all has been set up correctly.

We‚Äôve also produced a number of videos to help you get started:

= GETTING STARTED =

This quick tutorial shows you how to get the GatewayAPI Plugin for WordPress installed and configured and how to send an SMS.

https://vimeo.com/179720894

= RECIPIENTS, GROUPS AND EXTRA FIELDS =

This quick tutorial shows you how to create groups, add recipients to the groups, as well as how to add custom fields to the individual recipients, which allows any extra data to be stored and used in SMS messages.

https://vimeo.com/179720962

= BUILT-IN FORMS FOR SIGN UP, UPDATE AND UNSUBSCRIBE =

This tutorial shows you how to create forms for the public, using the built-in UI for creating ‚Äúshortcodes‚Äù (tiny pieces of code which can be pasted into any WordPress-page).

https://vimeo.com/179721068

= IMPORTING RECIPIENTS FROM SPREADSHEETS =

This tutorial shows you how to import recipients from any spreadsheet and into the recipients database in GatewayAPI. It even shows how to overwrite and update the database, import extra fields from spreadsheets and how to add the recipients into groups. It works with any spreadsheet app (Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice, Google Docs ‚Äì you name it!).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How well does this plugin handle 10,000+ recipients =

It works really well. We split large SMS broadcasts into multiple smaller requests, to ease the burden on your WordPress setup. You will see a progress bar, when you are sending to more than 500 recipients at a time.

= HELP! I‚Äôm administrator and I‚Äôm locked out of the two-factor system! =

If you don‚Äôt have a backup of the ‚ÄúEmergency bypass URL‚Äù from the setup-screen, then you need to dig into the database to disable the two-factor system. Your host probably has a phpMyAdmin that you can use to access it.
Then find the options-table, by default wp_options. Search for the row where the option_name is gwapi_security_enable. Simply delete the row.
